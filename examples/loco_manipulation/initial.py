"""
Contact-mode-sequence generator for humanoid loco-manipulation.

Only this one function is evolved by ShinkaEvolve. The notation, the
task, the scene IDs and how plans are judged are described in the
system prompt.

A `contact_mode_seq` is a dict of channels -> list of contact tuples
(one entry per mode). Channels are:

    "left_ee", "right_ee"     : (env_id, contact_type)            or () for free
    "left_sole", "right_sole" : (env_id, contact_type)            or () for free
    "<object_label>"          : (self_id, env_id, contact_type)   or () for free

contact_type: 1 = sticking, 2 = sliding (see the system prompt).
All channels in the dict must have the same length (= number of modes).

Helpers available in this module's namespace (do NOT redefine):

    get_initial_mode() -> Dict[str, List[Tuple]]
        Returns the scene's initial contact mode as a single-mode
        contact_mode_seq (length-1 channel lists). Use this as mode 0
        of your plan and append further modes from there.

    append_mode(plan, **channel_updates) -> None
        Appends one new mode to ``plan``. Channels not mentioned
        keep their previous value.

    walk(plan, n_steps) -> None
        Optional shorthand: appends n_steps alternating steps (right
        foot lifts first), finishing in double support on the same
        surfaces.

    The body below returns the initial mode unchanged (1 mode, which

    expected to extend it into a full plan.
